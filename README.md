# Glucoma-Detection
we have proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system for early detection of Glaucoma. Initially, eye images are augmented to generate data for Deep learning. The eye images are then pre- processed to remove noise using Gaussian Blur technique and make the image suitable for further processing.
